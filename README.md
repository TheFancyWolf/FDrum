# FDrum
Simple Decent Sampler library designed to be used to enhance acoustic drums or as a standalone instrument.

The goals of this project...
1. Speed - Quickly load the plugin in and audition different samples in each track slot
2. Simplicity - The goal is to get the base sounds chosen quickly and use other plugins in your DAW to get creative with the sounds. Do not overwhelm the user with choices.
3. Functional - Make sure the plugins simplicity is never limiting the user. Provide enough built in functionality so that plugins used after FDRUM are for creative purposes and reduce the need to use multiple versions of FDRUM.

## Install Decent Sampler and load FDRUM
1. Visit [Decent Sampler](https://www.decentsamples.com/product/decent-sampler-plugin/) and download the version for your system.
2. Download [FDrum.dsbundle](https://github.com/TheFancyWolf/FDrum/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) from this Git to wherever you like to keep your samples.
3. Open Decent Sampler as a standalone app or inside your DAW.
4. Click File -> Load and then navigate to the FDrum.dsbundle file and open it. Here is a [youtube short](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/yq4DZizEifY) if you need help.
5. FDRUM should now be ready to use!

## Using FDRUM
There are 15 sample categories on 15 individual tracks. Each track's color corresponds with the color on the Decent Sampler keyboard. 

Trigger samples using your keyboard, midi editor, or [from acoustic drums](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTNy4SYRNbo&pp=ygUkdHJpZ2dlciBtaWRpIGZyb20gZHJ1bXMgcmVhcGVyIG1hbmlh) using the following commands:

* C2 = 48 = Kick
* D2 = 50 = Snare
* E2 = 51 = Stick
* F2 = 53 = HH Closed
* G2 = 55 = HH Open
* A2 = 57 = Ride
* B2 = 59 = Crash
* C3 = 60 = Tom 1
* D3 = 62 = Tom 2
* E3 = 64 = Tom 3
* F3 = 65 = Shaker
* G3 = 67 = Tambourine
* A3 = 69 = Cow Bell
* B3 = 71 = Clap
* C4 = 72 = Aux 1
* D4 = 74 = Aux 2

In it's current Alpha state, there are only two temporary sample categories available to choose from (808 and LinnDrum).

You can mix and match samples for each track using the drop down below the track name. 

There are three parameters that can be adjusted per track. From top to bottom Tuning -> Panning -> Volume.

Globally you can adjust a LPF, HPF, Drive, and Reverb effects. The Output fader adjusted the output from Decent Sampler if needed.

Please report any issues and suggestions in the [issues](https://github.com/TheFancyWolf/FDrum/issues) page of this repository.

Future updates will include more sample categories, both traditional and unique.
